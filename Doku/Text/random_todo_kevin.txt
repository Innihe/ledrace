dont forget!

- fix draw logic when logicupdate +4 strip ending << !! for real
- recheck moving trough strip ending backwards
- maybe reorder position logic conditions for efficiency
- change magic numbers in position update logic to be derived from constant
- add speed < ~15 move only every second update
- rework speed boundaries
- benchmark and performance optimization
- code cleanup
- gravity topmost checks for first entity pixel instead of middle

- game end effect
- finish line cross effect needs rework? potential crash



didnt forget :p
- lol you can cheat lap system by going back and forth over finish line :d << DONE
- two player system << DONE
- rolling power for backwards movement and fix forward rolling after backward movement << DONE was cut during physics rework
- speed decay formular rework << DONE
- cap negative speed << DONE
- fix color ghosting bug when moving backwards << DONE
- fix logic bug when crossing strip ending backwards << DONE
